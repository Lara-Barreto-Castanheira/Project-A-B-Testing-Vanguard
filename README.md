# Vanguard AB Testing Project - README
## Overview
This project focuses on conducting A/B testing between two different user interfaces for Vanguard's platform. The primary objective is to perform various statistical tests on the collected data and visualize the results using Tableau. The insights gained from this analysis will guide decisions on the optimal user interfaces design for improved user experience and business outcomes.

## Project Objectives
Perform Statistical Analysis: Apply various statistical tests to determine the effectiveness of each UI variant.

## Visualize Results: Use Tableau to create visualizations that clearly communicate the results of the A/B tests.
Recommend UI Design: Based on the statistical analysis and visualizations, provide recommendations on which UI design to implement.

## Test Variants
Control: The current user interface, representing the standard design used by Vanguard.
Test: A new user interface, with design modifications intended to enhance user interaction and satisfaction.

## Metrics to Analyze
Conversion Rate: The percentage of users who complete a desired action, such as account sign-ups or product purchases.
Click-Through Rate (CTR): The ratio of users who click on a specific element or link compared to the total number of visitors.
Session Duration: The average time users spend on the site or app.
