# Vanguard A/B Testing Project - README
## Overview
This project focuses on conducting A/B testing between two different user interfaces for Vanguard's platform. The primary objective is to perform various statistical tests on the collected data and visualize the results using Tableau. The insights gained from this analysis will guide decisions on the optimal user interfaces design for improved user experience and business outcomes.

## Project Objectives
Perform Statistical Analysis: Apply various statistical tests to determine the effectiveness of each UI variant.

## Visualize Results: Use Tableau to create visualizations that clearly communicate the results of the A/B tests.
Based on the statistical analysis and visualizations, provide recommendations on which users interface design to implement.

## Test Variants
Control: The current user interface, representing the standard design used by Vanguard - Clients interacted with Vanguardâ€™s traditional online process.
Test: A new user interface, with design modifications intended to enhance user interaction and satisfaction - Clients experienced the new, spruced-up digital interface.

## Metrics to Analyze
1. Completion Rate: Percentage of users who completed the process in both the control and test versions.

2. Population Characterization: Comparison of demographic and behavioral characteristics between users in the control and test groups.

3. Error and Success Rate: Evaluation of the success rate and errors made by users during the process.


4. Repeated Steps: Average number of steps that were repeated by users, indicating difficulties or confusion during the process.

5. Time Spent (in minutes): Average time spent by users to complete the process.
